# Simon-Game
The Simon game is a fun memory challenge where you repeat sequences of colored lights and sounds. The game lights up one of its four colored buttons, and you have to press the same button. Each time you get it right, the sequence gets longer, testing your memory as you try to follow along. Keep going as long as you can without making a mistake!
